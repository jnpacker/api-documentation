These\n         signatures are in the atomic container signature format. The URL will have the digest\n         of the image appended to it as \"<STORE>/<ALGO>=<DIGEST>/signature-<NUMBER>\" as described\n         in the container image signing format. The docker-image-manifest section of the\n         signature must match the release image digest. Signatures are searched starting at\n         NUMBER 1 and incrementing if the signature exists but is not valid. The signature is a\n         GPG signed and encrypted JSON message. The file store is provided for testing only at\n         the current time, although future versions of the CVO might allow host mounting of\n         signatures.\nSee https://github.com/containers/image/blob/ab49b0a48428c623a8f03b41b9083d48966b34a9/docs/signature-protocols.md\nfor a description of the signature store\nThe returned verifier will require that any new release image will only be considered verified\nif each provided public key has signed the release image digest. The signature may be in any\nstore and the lookup order is internally defined.\nIf not set, no verification will be performed.",
